# MoodLink  
### *‚ÄúLinking people through emotional awareness.‚Äù*  

---

## üí° Inspiration  
We wanted to **bridge the gap between individuals with lower emotional intelligence (EQ)** and those they interact with online. Many people struggle to read facial cues during virtual conversations. *MoodLink* allows them to stay emotionally connected and aware of how those they converse with.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What It Does  
MoodLink is a **Chrome extension** that analyzes the **facial expressions** of the person you‚Äôre meeting with online.  

- Currently supports **one-on-one meetings** as well as **meetings with multiple individuals**.  
- Uses a **trained machine learning model** to detect emotional states such as **happy, sad, confused, bored,** or **neutral**.  
- While the extension is toggled on, it provides **real-time mood updates** every 3 seconds.  
- When toggled off, it generates a **summary report via Gemini**, showing the proportions of different moods observed during the session.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It  
- The **frontend** is built with JavaScript for the **GUI and background scripts**.  
- The **backend**, powered by **Django**, handles the analysis workflow.  
- Screenshots from meetings are captured, **cropped, and sanitized using OpenCV**, then sent via an **API call** to a **TensorFlow model** (done via [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/pose)) that classifies the mood. 
- The extension is packaged and managed through **manifest.json** for smooth integration in Chrome.
- Called **Gemini** via another API call to convert a table of the stored mood information into easily digestible text for the viewer to review.

## üöß Challenges We Ran Into  
1. Integrating the **frontend and backend** for seamless communication.  
2. Developing a **functional and reliable ML model** with limited time and data.  
3. Ensuring **state persistence** when switching browser tabs.  

---

## üèÜ Accomplishments We‚Äôre Proud Of  
1. Creating a **working machine learning model** capable of classifying emotions.  
2. Successfully building and deploying a **functional Chrome extension**, despite limited frontend experience.  

---

## üìö What We Learned  
1. How to **design and train a simple machine learning model**.  
2. The fundamentals of **building a Chrome extension**.  
3. Creating **usable UI elements** and managing **frontend-backend communication**.  
4. Making **functional API calls** with Django.

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next for MoodLink  
The path forward for this is to be able to personalize the extension a bit more by adding names and other elements that humanize the people on the other side of the screen as opposed to just metrics. This would likely appeal to users more and enable improved perception and interaction with the provided data. Additionally, making a separate model for speech mannerisms would also be an addition we could strive to achieve.
